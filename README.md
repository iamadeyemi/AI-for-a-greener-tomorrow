### 📚 Overview

**EcoVision** is a computer vision project that leverages deep learning to automatically classify waste into different categories. This can help promote environmental sustainability, support waste management automation, and encourage smarter recycling processes. The notebook contains end-to-end steps including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and predictions using PyTorch and Plotly.
